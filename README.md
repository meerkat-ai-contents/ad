# Welcome to AD !

Anomaly Detection is AI content that identifies abnormal patterns or outliers within data. It leverages statistical and machine learning techniques to automatically distinguish between normal and abnormal data ranges without the need for separate labeling. Anomaly Detection provides models for detecting point anomalies (PAD), which identify individual data points that deviate from the normal range; contextual anomalies (CAD, TBD), which identify abnormal patterns that deviate from the normal pattern; and multivariate anomalies (MAD, TBD), which comprehensively learn the relationships between multivariate data to detect abnormal points and patterns. This versatility allows Anomaly Detection to be applied to various data characteristics and objectives.
